We need "bt" etc. all to be L at the same time, which means we need all of the
elements of "mj" etc. to be H at the same time.

These are all powers of 2, so this is like a large binary number that we need to
come up all 1's at the same time.

Some places are repeated ... but I think we can ignore the repeats.

- At 2048, the 2048 one is finally H but all the others are L. So at 4095 everything should be H, right?

- Nope. Something happens at 3072, which is 2048 + 1024. So this one ("md") goes:

  L for 2048
  H for 1024
  L for 2796 (2048 + 748) ... huh

- So, something happens at 5869 ... which is prime
